---

**Testing Hardware Tools:**

* Logic analyzers  

    * [Saleae Logic Analyzer](https://www.saleae.com/) - USB-based logic analyzer used to capture digital signals on the SPI bus for analysis and reverse engineering.

* Bus sniffers

    * [Beagle SPI Sniffer](https://beagleboard.org/spi-sniffer) - Low-cost SPI bus sniffer using Beaglebone Black board to intercept live SPI traffic.

* Flash dumpers

    * [Dediprog](https://www.dediprog.com/) - Standalone SPI flash programmer used to read out firmware from SPI flash memory chips. 

* Glitching tools

    * [ChipWhisperer Glitch Module](https://wiki.newae.com/Glitching_Attacks) - Generates precisely timed clock and voltage glitches on target SPI lines to cause faults.

* SCA tools  

    * [ChipWhisperer CW305](https://www.newae.com/tools/chipwhisperer-cw305-soc-fpga-board) - FPGA board used to capture power consumption during SPI communication for side-channel analysis.

* Microprobing stations

    * [Nanonics MV200](https://www.njp.com/mv200-1800.html) - Workstation with micromanipulators to physically probe SPI chip buses after decapsulation.

* Oscilloscopes

    * [Rigol DS1054Z](https://www.rigolna.com/products/digital-oscilloscopes/ds1000z/) - Oscilloscope used to analyze SPI timing signals, measure voltage levels, etc.

* Multimeters

    * [Fluke 117](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/product/electrical-testing/digital-multimeters/fluke-117) - Measures voltage, resistance, continuity of SPI bus lines and chip pins.

* JTAG debuggers

    * [Xilinx Platform Cable USB II](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/hw-usb-ii-g.html) - Used for low-level JTAG debug access to SPI-enabled FPGAs and CPLDs.

* SPI adapters

    * Bus Pirate - Adapter board that communicates with SPI chips using common protocols.

    * Saleae Logic Analyzer - Also works as SPI adapter in addition to logic analyzer.

    * STMicroelectronics ST-Link/V2 - JTAG adapter that can access SPI-enabled MCUs like STM32.

**Testing Software Tools:**

* Flash dumper software

    * [Flashrom](https://flashrom.org/Flashrom) - Open source utility used to read firmware from SPI flash memory chips.

* Decompilers

    * [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - Reverse engineers compiled firmware binaries into source code format.

* Disassemblers

* Hex editors

    * [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) - Used to view and manipulate firmware binary files in hexadecimal format. 

* SPI frame generators

    * [SCU](https://www.totalphase.com/protocols/spi/) - Generates arbitrary SPI protocol frames for testing and analysis.

* Glitch pattern generators

    * [FaceDancer Glitch Utilities](https://github.com/bishopfox/facedancer-glitch-utilities) - Python scripts generating patterns of clock/voltage glitches for fault injection.

* SCA software

    * [ChipWhisperer Analyzer](https://wiki.newae.com/ChipWhisperer/Main#ChipWhisperer_Analyzer) - Processes power traces to extract encryption keys using techniques like DPA.
